/**
 * This class is currently unimplemented, but I believe the idea for creating it was to have a multidimensional table along axiis of
 * card value, suit, upgrades and seals, with a number representing the amount of that card plotted to match a position in that space
 * Basically a table similar to the one you see when you hover over your deck in the game, but expanded to include seals and modifications
 * Then, with this table, perform analysis on it.
 * 
 * Such a table could also be useful if i decide to create a neural network that plays the game, using these values as an input
 * 
 * NOTE: I already have a DeckTable class which only handles suit and value. Perhaps that could be expanded upon by having this class extand that class
